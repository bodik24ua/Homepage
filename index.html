                  <h2>Résumé</h2>
                  <p>&mdash; Hello! I’m a German singer, songwriter, and poet. Best known as the lead vocalist and
                    lyricist of Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein and solo project Lindemann. Rammstein have sold over
                    45 million records worldwide, with five of their albums receiving platinum status, and Lindemann has
                    been listed among the "50 Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time" by Roadrunner Records. He has
                    appeared in minor roles in films and has also published two books of poetry: Messer ("Knife") in
                    2002 and In stillen Nächten ("In Silent Nights") in 2013. He has presented some of his original
                    poems and scripts to galleries.</p>

                <h3>Poetry</h3>
                <p class="tags small">In 2018, Lindemann embarked on a book signing tour across Russia for his poetry
                  book, Messer, originally released in German and then translated into Russian and re-released to the
                  Russian market. Lindemann showed up to his book signing in Moscow with an unknown person in a gimp
                  costume. The female gimp was led through the crowd by Lindemann before he sat down to sign autographs
                  and talk to fans.[35] It is still unknown who was in the outfit, but suggestions are that of his
                  girlfriend at the time.</p>

                <p class="tags small">Two songs from the album Herzeleid were used in David Lynch's 1997 film, Lost
                  Highway.[36] Lindemann has also played minor roles in some films, appearing with his bandmate
                  Christoph Schneider as musicians in the 1999 film Pola X,[37] playing a character named Viktor in the
                  children's comedy film Amundsen der Pinguin (2003), and also appearing as an animal rights activist in

                <h3>Early life&#x1f603;</h3>
                <p class="tags small">Lindemann was born on 4 January 1963 in Leipzig (then in East Germany),[1][2] the
                  son of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) journalist Brigitte Hildegard "Gitta" Lindemann and poet Werner
                  Lindemann.[3] His parents first met at a conference in Bitterfeld in 1959.[4] He grew up in
                  Wendisch-Rambow alongside his younger sister, Saskia.[3][5] At age 11, Lindemann went to a sports
                  school at the Empor Rostock Sport Club,[5] and attended a boarding school from 1977 to 1980.[5] His
                  parents lived separately for career reasons after 1975, and divorced when Lindemann was still
                  young.[6] He lived with his father for a short time, but the relationship was unhealthy; in the book
                  Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl, his father wrote about his own problems with alcoholism and the
                  difficulties of being a father to a teenage Lindemann.[7]</p>
                <p>
                  In 1978, Lindemann participated in the European Junior Swimming Championships in Florence, finishing
                  11th in the 1500 m freestyle and 7th in the 400 m freestyle, swimming a time of 4'17"58; he was
                  shortlisted to go to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow,[6] but left the sport due to an injury.[8] According
                  to Lindemann, "I never liked the sport school actually, it was very intense. But as a child you don't
                  object."[1] He later worked as an apprentice carpenter, a gallery technician, a peat cutter, and a
                  basket weaver.[9] His mother dedicated a letter titled Mein Sohn, der Frontmann von Rammstein ("My
                  son, the frontman of Rammstein") to Lindemann in 2009.[10] The first album he owned was Deep Purple's
                  Stormbringer.[11]

                <h3>Personal life&#x1f61e;</h3>
                <p class="tags small">Lindemann's daughter Nele was born in 1985, and he spent the first seven years of
                  her life as a single father.[12] He has one grandson through Nele.[52] On 28 February 1991, his
                  ex-wife and his Rammstein bandmate Richard Kruspe had a daughter together named Khira, who shares her
                  surname with Lindemann rather than Kruspe as her mother retained the surname when they divorced and
                  never married Kruspe. Lindemann's second daughter, Marie Louise, was born in 1993 to ex-wife Anja
                  Köseling.[53] He dated actress and model Sophia Thomalla from April 2011 to November 2015.</p>
                <p>
                  Lindemann is an atheist.[54][55] In a 2011 interview, he said that he still has strong connections to
                  the traditions of East Germany,[27] and that he finds "de-traditionalisation" disturbing and believes
                  there is "no longer any authenticity".[27] Contrary to his musical style, he has stated that he "hates
                  noise" and often spends time in a small village somewhere in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the name of which
                  he has not disclosed.[52]</p>
                <p>
                  In 2014, Lindemann presented two sculptures and his original scripts of poems in his book In stillen
                  Nächten (In Silent Nights) in a Dresden gallery.[56] He also wrote some lyrics in 2014 for German
                  Schlager singer Roland Kaiser for his album Soul Tracks.[57]</p>

                <h3>Music&#x1f97a;</h3>
                <p class="tags small bulleted">Lindemann started to play drums for Schwerin-based experimental rock band
                  First Arsch in 1986,[12] who released an album titled Saddle Up in 1992, and played one song ("Lied
                  von der unruhevollen Jugend") with a punk band called Feeling B, which was the former band of
                  Rammstein members Paul Landers, Christoph Schneider and Christian "Flake" Lorenz in 1989.[12] During
                  his time in Feeling B, he played the drums in the band.[12] In the 1990s, Lindemann began to write
                  lyrics. In 1994, the band entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track
                  demo professionally. When questioned as to why Rammstein was named after the Ramstein air show
                  disaster,[13] he said he viewed images of the incident on television, and that he and the bandmates
                  wanted to make a musical memorial.</p>
